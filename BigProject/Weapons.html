                    <p>The katana is the only primary weapon, and the progression of gameplay is done by improving one's Skills rather than finding other or better weapons.

                        The main Katana is called Kusabimaru. This weapon cannot be upgraded, but can be enhanced with the Prosthetic Tools if certain skills are unlocked.
                        
                        The secondary sword is called Fushigiri and has some relation to Kuro, the Divine Heir. This sword is used to deliver the final Deathblow to the undying-type enemies and Bosses encountered throughout the game. The final deathblow with Kusabimaru is called Shinobi Execution, if involving Fushigiri it would be called Immortality Severed, also in one particular situation it would be called Gracious Gift of Tears.</p>
