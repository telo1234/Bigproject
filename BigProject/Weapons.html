                    <p>The katana, named Kusabimaru, is the primary weapon and cannot be upgraded, but can be enhanced with Prosthetic Tools if certain skills are unlocked. The secondary sword, Fushigiri, is related to Kuro, the Divine Heir, and is used for the final Deathblow to undying enemies and bosses. The final Deathblow with Kusabimaru is called Shinobi Execution, with Fushigiri, it's called Immortality Severed, and in a specific situation, Gracious Gift of Tears.</p>
